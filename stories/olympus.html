It can be as simple as learning their language, or taking lessons from their way of life. We can learn a lot more from them than we realise."</p>

                  	<p> Although Luang Prabang was not severely affected by the bombing, it opened the UXO Visitors Centre some 13 years later to leverage on the city’s tourism boom. The launch of the centre also helped to educate tourists and local students about the history of the UXOs. <br>
                    <br>
                    “Some students in Laos cannot read English, so there’s a special programme that translates all the information about UXOs into the Lao language to reach more students,” said Mr Khotisen. <br>
                    <br>
                    Furthemore, the centre houses a collection of authentic metal souvenirs, similar to those found at the night market. However, the ones found at the centre are made by villages from Ban Ha Hine, a village well-known for its blacksmiths. <br>
                    <br>
                    Proceeds from the sales are then used to raise funds for the organisation and centre. <br>
                    <br>
                    Mr Khotisen said: "I’m not sure if the products sold in night markets are made completely out of UXO metal, but those sold in the museum are 100 per cent made of UXO metal. <br>
                    <br>
                    “In the future, we want to make different souvenirs to differentiate ourselves from the fake ones.” <span style="color: #E3B953">&#8718;</span> </p>
